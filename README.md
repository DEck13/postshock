# postshock

`postshock` is a small toolkit for **time-series forecasting around
shocks/breaks**.  
It helps you learn from the **pre-shock** window, forecast into the
**post-shock** period, and optionally adjust those forecasts using
information from **donor series**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Highlights

- **Donor Balancing Weights (`dbw`)**  
  Compute donor weights on the pre-shock window so donors match the
  target in covariates. Supports scaling/centering, bounds, and L1/L2
  penalties.

- **Automatic order selection (`auto_garchx`)**  
  Grid search + IC selection for GARCH-X / GJR-GARCH with robust
  covariance and backcast handling.

- **Synthetic prediction (`SynthPrediction`)**  
  Fit (S)ARIMA with a post-shock indicator on each donor, aggregate
  donor “shock effects” via DBW (or uniform weights), and adjust the
  target’s k-step forecast.

- **Synthetic volatility forecasting (`SynthVolForecast`)**  
  Forecast variance with a pre-shock GARCH-X on the target and add a
  donor-based shock adjustment.

- **Practical API**  
  Clean function interfaces, guardrail tests, and documentation for
  quick adoption.
